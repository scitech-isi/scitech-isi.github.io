Teaching topics related to Cyberinfrastructure (CI) is most effective 
when students have opportunities for hands-on learning. Participation 
and pedagogic challenges stem from the need to provide students with 
access to CI platforms, and to expose students to a variety of different 
learning scenarios. By using simulation, a software artifact that mimics 
real-world executions, these challenges are obviated as the only 
requirement is that students have access to a computer and as simulated 
executions can target arbitrary hardware and software stack 
configurations. This research effort has been initiated by 
[Dr Rafael Ferreira da Silva](https://rafaelsilva.com/).
