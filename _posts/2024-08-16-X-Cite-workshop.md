# Scitech at X-Cite workshop

The Pegasus (SciTech) group actively participated in workshop was a training workshop in which we presented in June 2024. 

Members of the Scitech team had the oppurtunity to participate in a day-long workshop which addresses the computing
needs of CHESS players. Anirban Mandal (UNC), Erik Scott(UNC), Sajith Sasidharan (UNC), Karan Vahi (USC) brought expertise in 
distributed systems and scientific computing. 

The aim of the day-long workshop was to address the computing needs of CHESS users — from data collection during beamtime through subsequent data analysis — by leveraging the knowledge, experience, and research expertise of the X-CITE team. Contributing members Anirban Mandal (UNC), Erik Scott(UNC), Sajith Sasidharan (UNC), Karan Vahi (USC) brought expertise in distributed systems, scientific computing, and scientific workflows, while Kelly Nygren (CHESS) and Werner Sun (CLASSE) imparted their institutional know-how to provide a complete and thorough overview of CHESS computing.

Key topics included the basics of the CHESS research workflow, data collection software, the Linux operating system, and Python programming. Participants also received an overview of the cyberinfrastructure resources available at CHESS and beyond
