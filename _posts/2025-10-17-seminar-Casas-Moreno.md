title: "Autonomous Decision-Making for Services in the Compute Continuum"
image: /images/news/Moreno-seminar.jpg
description: |
  The Compute Continuum has emerged as a new distributed computing paradigm that extends traditional centralized cloud environments with dynamic and heterogeneous resources, ranging from IoT devices to HPC centers. The heterogeneity and dynamicity of the Continuum is pushing computer scientists to rethink how services are defined, deployed, and coordinated in these new environments. Advancing this field enables applications with societal impact, such as urgent computing, precision agriculture, and resilient energy grids.

This paradigm shift is reshaping middleware design, moving away from centralized orchestrators toward dynamic, decentralized, peer-to-peer platforms. In this talk, I will present my work at the Workflows and Distributed Computing group at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, where we are developing a programming environment for defining, deploying and operating services in the Continuum. Our approach implements concepts from swarm computing and multi-agent systems, enabling devices to act as autonomous agents that make coordinated decisions to collectively meet quality of service demands.

Particularly, I will introduce ongoing work on decision-making strategies for the Continuum, with a focus on applying and extending the greedy consensus algorithm developed by Prof. Ewa Deelman’s group. Originally applied to decentralize workflow management systems, we are exploring how this algorithm can be integrated into our environment to enable adaptive, self-managing services across the Continuum.

AI applications like large language models require significant computing resources. 
  LUMI, Europe’s third most powerful supercomputer, is already one of the world’s most 
  powerful AI platforms for science, playing important role in supporting European RI community. 
  The EuroHPC Joint Undertaking (JU) has selected the hosting sites of the next EuroHPC 
  supercomputers and AI Factories. One of the chosen hosting sites is Finland, led by 
  CSC – IT Center for Science, together with a LUMI AI Factory consortium of five other countries: 
  the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Norway and Poland. An AI Factory is an ecosystem that 
  enables AI researchers and developers to have one-stop access to 
  the high-performance computing (HPC), data sets and skills they need. 
  The aim is to make it as easy as possible for both scientific researchers 
  and industrial innovators to adopt AI methods on a large scale. In this talk, 
  I will present the architecture of the LUMI infrastructure and its status, together with 
  plans and ambitions for the near future. Then, an overview of how LUMI AI supports RI communities based 
  on the scientific showcases and achievements will be presented. These include, for example, contributions 
  to the Destination Earth initiative, work on large language models and breakthroughs from extreme-scale computing 
  capabilities in many fields of science.

Speaker: Xavier Casas Moreno, Barcelona Supercomputing Center

## Bio:

Xavier Casas-Moreno received his PhD from KTH Royal Institute of Technology (2023, Stockholm), where he developed multidisciplinary tools to automate high-throughput super-resolution microscopy at the group of Prof. Ilaria Testa. His work combined signal theory, optical design and implementation, and software engineering, and led to the creation of ImSwitch, an open-source platform for microscope control, image reconstruction, and automation. He received a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative grant to integrate ImSwitch with napari, a multi-dimensional image viewer with extensive community support.

Motivated by the role of software engineering in multidisciplinary applications, he joined the Workflows and Distributed Computing group (led by Prof. Rosa M Badia) at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center as a postdoctoral researcher. There, he contributed to the COLMENA project, a programming environment for hyper-distributed applications across the Computing Continuum. His research is supported by a Juan de la Cierva fellowship (2024–2026) and a DISCOVER-US exchange grant, which will allow him to collaborate with Prof. Ewa Deelman’s group at ISI.
