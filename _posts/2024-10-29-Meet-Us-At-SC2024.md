# Meet us at SC24

The Pegasus (SciTech) group will be actively participating in several events and 
presenting talks in workshops, panels, and exhibitors booths at SC24. Find below 
a list of events where you can meet our team.

We look forward to seeing you in Atlanta, Georgia!

# Wednesday, November 20th:
Converged HPC and Cloud Computing in the Era of Generative Al

Type: Birds of a Feather
Time: 5:15pm – 6:45pm EST
Location: B312-B313A
Organizers: Daniel Milroy, Rosa M Badia, Ewa Deelman, Todd Gamblin, 
Andrew Jones, Bill Magro, Bill Seetharami Seelam, Michela Taufer

# Description

Cloud computing technologies such as elastic scaling, application 
containerization and orchestration are gaining prevalence in HPC due 
to their benefits of resource dynamism, automation, reproducibility, 
and resilience. Similarly, HPC technologies are being integrated into 
cloud infrastructures to enable traditional HPC workloads and emerging 
GenAI workloads which have HPC characteristics. This trend is leading to 
converged computing, an environment that combines the best capabilities 
from both worlds. In this highly interactive BoF, we invite the broader 
computing community to discuss its experiences with converged computing 
and share its views on the future considering the astronomical growth of 
GenAI and resource contention.

# General Talks to Community in the Exhibition Hall

-2PM EST SWARM talk in USC booth 839 – Pawel Zuk
-2PM EST TBD talk in USC booth 839 – Suman Raj

# Thursday, November 21st:
Advancing the State of the Art in Distributed Services for HPC

Type: Panel
Time: 10:30am – 12pm EST
Location: B310
Organizers: Daniel Milroy, Rosa M Badia, Ewa Deelman, Todd Gamblin, 
Andrew Jones, Bill Magro, Bill Seetharami Seelam, Michela Taufer

# Description

Distributed services are a pervasive element of large-scale computing: 
they aggregate system resources, abstract reusable application functionality, 
and coordinate work among distributed applications. These services form the 
backbone of data management, scheduling, in situ analytics, performance instrumentation, 
AI workflow coupling, integrated research infrastructure, and more across cloud, edge, 
and HPC environments. The goal of this panel is to bring together leading experts to 
identify fundamental cross-cutting challenges and opportunities for the distributed 
services community in HPC. What are the technical hurdles, how can services adapt to 
the increasing scale of systems and applications, what can we learn from other communities,
and how can we advance the state of the art and adoption of distributed services for HPC?
