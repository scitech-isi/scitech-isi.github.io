# It is our pleasure to introduce our new Research Engineer Mohammad Zaiyan Alam to the SciTech team

Zaiyan obtained his MS in Computer Science from USC in 2021. He is interested
in Machine Learning, Distributed Systems and Computer Vision. Outside of research,
Zaiyan enjoys calligraphy and playing soccer. When asked what Olympic sport he
would compete in, if given the chance, he said, "I would choose the 100m dash!"

Welcome to the team, Zaiyan!
