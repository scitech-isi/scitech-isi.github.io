description: "This talk explores scheduling problems in the context of large-scale applications  from a memory perspective. We focus here on two very different levels of memory in the hierarchy: caches and burst buffers.With the recent advent of many-core architectures such as chip multiprocessors (CMP), the number of processing units is increasing."

Predictive maintenance aims at anticipating the failures of industrial equipment to 
allow an early scheduling of corrective actions. Such an approach to maintenance is 
based on a detailed analysis that considers the technical and contextual 
characteristics of the specific industrial equipment. However, this analysis 
requires an important period of time to collect a significant quantity of data 
in order to train a predictive model. Federated learning is a promising approach 
that allows multiple participants to build collaboratively a global predictive model.
This approach has been widely explored in generic IoT applications and large-scale 
architectures. However, implementing FL in real-world environments requires 
considering several issues to adapt it to existing IoT architectures, 
including managing/orchestrating federated tasks and dealing with computing 
resource limitations. Indeed, most current research focuses on aggregating 
heavyweight deep learning algorithms. In this talk, we present an architecture 
for FL in the context of IoT, based on the ETSI-standardized 3-layer architecture. 
We also outline a stacking-based aggregation method to build the global model in a 
cost-effective manner. Finally, we evaluate the performance and efficiency of 
this approach on real-world usage scenarios
