description: |
  AI applications like large language models require significant computing resources. LUMI, Europe’s third most powerful   supercomputer, is already one of the world’s most powerful AI platforms for science, playing important role in           supporting European RI community.

  The EuroHPC Joint Undertaking (JU) has selected the hosting sites of the next EuroHPC supercomputers and AI Factories. 
  One of the chosen hosting sites is Finland, led by CSC – IT Center for Science, together with a LUMI AI Factory          consortium of five other countries: the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Norway and Poland.

  An AI Factory is an ecosystem that enables AI researchers and developers to have one-stop access to 
  the high-performance computing (HPC), data sets and skills they need. The aim is to make it as easy 
  as possible for both scientific researchers and industrial innovators to adopt AI methods on a large scale.

  In this talk, I will present the architecture of the LUMI infrastructure and its status, together with 
  plans and ambitions for the near future. Then, an overview of how LUMI AI supports RI communities based 
  on the scientific showcases and achievements will be presented. These include, for example, contributions 
  to the Destination Earth initiative, work on large language models and breakthroughs from extreme-scale computing 
  capabilities in many fields of science.
