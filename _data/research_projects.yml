- title: 'Reproducibility and Cyberinfrastructure for Computational and Data-Enabled Science'
  description: This project seeks to improve understanding of how the scientific community can adapt to the increasing use of computing and large-scale data resources. One challenge is ensuring that computational results -such as those from simulations- are "reproducible", that is, the same results areobtained when one re-uses the same input data, methods, software and analysis conditions. In 2019, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) issued a report on "Reproducibility and Replication in Science" with a series of recommendations. The project will assess the implications of these recommendations on the scientific discovery process for computationally and data-enabled research.

- title: 'PAGE: Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology'
  description: Over recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have allowed researchers to uncover hundreds of genetic variants associated with common diseases. However, the discovery of genetic variants through GWAS research represents just the first step in the challenging process of piecing together the complex biological picture of common diseases. To help speed the process, the National Human Genome Research Institute, is supporting new research in existing large epidemiology studies, all with a rich range of measures of health and potential disease, and many with long-term follow-up. The focus of the new research is on how genetic variants initially identified through GWAS research are related to a person’s biological and physical characteristics, such as weight, cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels or bone density. Scientists will also examine how non-genetic factors, such as diet, medications and smoking, may interact with genetic factors or each other to influence health outcomes.

- title: 'MINT: Model Integration through Knowledge-Rich Data and Process Composition'
  description: 'Major societal and environmental challenges require forecasting how natural processes and human activities affect one another. There are many areas of the globe where climate affects water resources and therefore food availability, with major economic and social implications. Today, such analyses require significant effort to integrate highly heterogeneous models from separate disciplines, including geosciences, agriculture, economics, and social sciences. Model integration requires resolving semantic, spatio-temporal, and execution mismatches, which are largely done by hand today and may take more than two years. The Model INTegration (MINT) project will develop a modeling environment which will significantly reduce the time needed to develop new integrated models, while ensuring their utility and accuracy. Research topics to be addressed include: 1) New principle-based semiautomatic ontology generation tools for modeling variables, to ground analytic graphs to describe models and data; 2) A novel workflow compiler using abductive reasoning to hypothesize new models and data transformation steps; 3) A new data discovery and integration framework that finds new sources of data, learns to extract information from both online sources and remote sensing data, and transforms the data into the format required by the models; 4) A new methodology for spatio-temporal scale selection; 5) New knowledge-guided machine learning algorithms for model parameterization to improve accuracy; 6) A novel framework for multi-modal scalable workflow execution; and 7) Novel composable agroeconomic models.'

The integration of Pegasus and ORCA enables powerful application- and data-driven virtual topology embedding into multiple institutional and national substrates (providers of cyber-resources, like computation, storage and networks). ADAMANT leverages ExoGENI – an NSF-funded GENI testbed, as well as national providers of on-demand bandwidth services (NLR, I2, ESnet) and existing OSG computational resources to create elastic, isolated environments to execute complex distributed tasks. This approach improves the performance of these applications and, by explicitly including data movement planning into the application workflow, enables new unique capabilities for distributed data-driven “Big Science” applications.'
